1 Introduction

1.1 Purpose of application
A simple application for smartphones where students can gather to sell and buy used books needed at courses given at Chalmers (and possibly other Universities). Users can register books for sale and other users can search and find these books. The unique selling point compared to existing sites like blocket or tradera is the niche market. When buying from our application you know that the seller is close by and that you can set up a meeting to get the book the same day.


1.2 General characteristics of application
No transactions are handled by the application. The application simply matches buyer with seller and provides the opportunity for market mechanisms to function in the interaction between these two parties.
Functionality to add a plethora of attributes about the book and for users to search for books on these criterias. Also the ability to describe a book in general and to upload a photo of the book taken with the mobile camera. A book could be uploaded by filling in a ISBN-number and then obtaining book title, author and edition.

Possible functions to be added in future versions:
- Auctions
- Connection to Cremona to compare price and to buy new books
- A website connected to the application
