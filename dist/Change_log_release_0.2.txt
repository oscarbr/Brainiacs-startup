Two bugs are fixed.

Added Unit tests for all classes. However, some do not yet test any actual methods in the class.


2. Removed features
This release has removed a button for taking pictures. 


3. Changes
Two bugs have been solved, see title 4 below. 


4. Bug fixes
Bug issue #23 (parseLibris returns String values with "") is solved. When running unit-tests this issue with parseLibris was found. String values should be parsed without quotation marks.

Bug Issue #34 (Issue with corrupted user-details) is solved. Catching exceptions and takes action. Minor fix.
User details were easily corruptable, especially when initiated through AddBookActivity.Possible solution: Make sure only one instance of the SettingsActivity is initiated.


5. Known bugs
Bug issue #11 (If the mobile lacks internet connection it force closes) is still known. If the mobile lacks internet connection, the application experiences an error and shuts down.

Bug issue #33 (NOMAD blocking Libris request) is known. 

Bug issue #36 (search short list sorts on ad-date instead of price) found via test 2.1.4-P.


6. Planned changes
The next step will be to implement more functionality related to editing entries in the database as well as making the scripts return better formatted data. The database also needs to be updated to include more information about a user adding a book.

Implementation of 1.1.2 has been put up a couple of releases. Add more test to get a better code coverage of activities. In the future much of the code needs to be looked over and refactored where possible.

Requirements for the next release is: 
1.2 - The seller can update information about a book or take a book off of the market
2.1.4 - A search can be sorted on any of the available attributes that a book can have. Originally it is sorted by price
2.2 - Buyer can upload a buy request
