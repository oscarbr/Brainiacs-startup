1 Introduction

1.1 Purpose of application

1.1.1 Stakeholders
There are several stakeholders.



Det finns flera intressenter till vår applikation. Från användarsidan finns det till exempel: studenter på Chalmers tekniska högskola som vill köpa och sälja böcker (här behöver vi göra skillnad på krav från köpare respektive säljare), studienämnder och andra student-organisationer, Cremona bokhandel, andra bokhandlare, lärare etc. 

Från utvecklarsidan finns det till exempel:
Handledare, utvecklare, testare, beta-testare etc. 

Vi ser studienämnder och de faktiska användarna av vår applikation som de två största kravställarna. Eftersom vi kommer hantera användare för vår 
programvara räknar vi med att många testfall kommer behövas.

1.2 General characteristics of application
No transactions are handled by the application. The application simply matches buyer with seller and provides the opportunity for market mechanisms to function in the interaction between the two parties.
