Muffins project (Chalmers Bookstore)
====================================
An app for buying and selling used course literature at Chalmers. There are many buyers and sellers, but not a proper platform. Chalmers bookstore is a simple app for students to post used books for sale. Functions such as adding photos from smartphone camera, course, year, author, title,  automatic info fetch from ISBN number etc. Some way of response between peers might also be implemented.

The process will be simpler than when selling the book on eBay or Blocket, since there is a specific intended market, users have some idea of who they are trading with and are able to make the transaction in person. 

The books will be categorized according to program, course and year of study to ease searching for relevant literature.
